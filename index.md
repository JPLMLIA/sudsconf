# Bringing Together Physical Scientists and Data Scientists

We invite researchers, leaders, practicioners, and students to join us for our 1st annual SUDS Workshop and Conference!

We are still organizing this opportunity for the community to discuss how science-driven collaborations between scientists and data scientists can advance our understanding of our universe. Meanwhile, please check out the following:

- The [**Workshop Program**](/program/workshop.md) describes how a small group of institutional leaders will collaborate to improve the SUDS practice.
- The [**Conference Call**](/call.md) describes the type of work we hope our conference attendees will share with the SUDS community.
- The [**SUDS Website**](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/suds) and the [**Report**](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/suds/suds-report) contain more information about the SUDS effort at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Thank you for your interest, and we hope to see you there!
