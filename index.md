# Science Understanding through Data Science
#### *Bringing Together Physical Scientists and Data Scientists*

We invite researchers, leaders, practicioners, and students to join us for our 1st annual SUDS Workshop and Conference!

We are still organizing this opportunity for the community to discuss how science-driven collaborations between scientists and data scientists can advance our understanding of our universe. Meanwhile, please check out the following:

- The [**Workshop Program**](/program/workshop.md) describes how a small group of institutional leaders will collaborate to improve the SUDS practice.
- The [**Conference Call**](/call.md) describes the type of work we hope our conference attendees will share with the SUDS community.
- The [**SUDS Website**](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/suds) and the [**Report**](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/suds/suds-report) contain more information about the SUDS effort at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Thank you for your interest, and we hope to see you there!
