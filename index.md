Recent interdisciplinary collaborations between physical scientists and data scientists have yielded significant advancements in both fields. In order to establish a strong community of science and data science collaborators, we invite researchers, practitioners, leaders, and students to join us for our inaugural SUDS Conference.

This three-day conference will feature...
- Keynotes and panels from experts in SUDS-like collaborations
- Townhalls for findings from our [Workshop by institutional leaders](program/workshop.html)
- [Technical posters and talks](call.html) by researchers and students in this fast-growing community
