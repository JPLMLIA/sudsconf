# Author Instructions

As you prepare your presentation, please keep the following in mind:

- Place an equal emphasis on physical science and data science contributions.
- Clearly describe the physical science impact and contribution.
    - Why is this work important in this field?
    - What did a data science collaboration make possible?
- Clearly describe the data science contribution or methodology.
    - Why was this methodology or model chosen over others?
    - How can others use this tool for their projects?
- Most attendees will *not* be in your scientific field. Provide enough introduction and context so that attendees from other fields can still learn from your work.
- Describe any insights about physical science and data science collaborations
    - How did the collaborators communicate?
    - What worked? *What didn't work?*
    - What changes would have made this collaboration easier?
