# Registration

### SUDS Workshop

We have not yet sent out formal invitations for the SUDS Workshop, which will support less than 30 participants. Instructions for registration will be included in our invitation email.

### SUDS Conference

You do not need an invitation to attend the conference; however, due to our limited venue size and resources during our inaugural year, we will only be able to accept 200 participants. We will prioritize attendance for workshop participants and accepted abstract authors, but we anticipate that there will be space for other attendees as well. Please submit a [NOI](https://forms.gle/qua7ytCEXyGRP7gs6) if you are interested in attending, and we will send you updates when our abstract submission and registration opens. There will be no registration fee.
