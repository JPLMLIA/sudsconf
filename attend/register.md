# Registration

### SUDS Workshop

*Please note that no invitations have been sent yet.*

The SUDS Workshop is invite-only, and we anticipate less than 30 participants. Invitees should respond to the invitation letter to receive an account to the conference management platform. 

### SUDS Conference

Due to the limited venue and resources during our inaugural year, attendence will be limited to 200 participants.

Workshop participants and accepted abstract authors will be prioritized. Registrants without an abstract submission may apply for participation once the application form opens.

We do not anticipate a registration fee for our inaugural year, but this may change. An announcement will be made.
