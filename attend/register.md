# Conference Registration

Due to our limited venue size and resources during our inaugural year, we will only be able to accept 200 participants. We will prioritize attendance for authors of accepted abstracts, but we anticipate that other attendees will also be able to participate. [Submitting your one-page abstract](https://sudsconf.com/call.html) is the easiest way to attend this conference, but general registration will be opened after author notification. There will be no registration fee.
